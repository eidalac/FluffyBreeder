Fluffies are FICTIONAL creatures - Real Life animal abuse is a serious issue, immoral and illegal.

2. What is a fluffy?

“Fluffy Ponies (Equus ferus caballus hasbioidae) are small creatures with fluffy bodies, childish speech, and low cognitive intelligence. Generally depicted as simple creatures literally designed to love and play, they are a subset of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fandom. ”

The short version is they were a gag/joke created related to the My Little Pony fandom, but has been around long enough to be its own entity.

3.  What is this game?

This is a text based game (TWINE, Javascript) based around, well, breeding and selling fluffies. 

The player is the owner of the shop and will need to buy/find, train, raise, breed and sell them for profit.  

Currently the game is in a pre-alpha state, most features do nothing, are disabled or do not work as they will in the final version.

The primary game cycle will consist of training/selling fluffies to generate income and managing a stress level.  Running out of funds or high on stress for too long will lead to a ‘bad end’.

4.  Will there be abuse/hugbox?

Yes. 

The game will have events that fire each in game week, and depending on player decisions you will unlock content in either direction via an experience system.

In general you will never be forced to pick one or the other.

The exception to this is if the player suffers high levels of stress, which may cause them to act violently in a fugue state.
